As the title suggests, it&#8217;s been a little over a year since I moved to Norway for work… It&#8217;s been a challenging year to say the least, and not only because of COVID-19.

For starters, it&#8217;s been hard to get used to this weird country&#8217;s ways (and I mean this in the most endearing way), from personal space, weather and language to food (I am Mexican and I cannot stress the importance of food enough, see my [previous entry](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/09/15/mexican-food/) for reference). Everything has been a bit difficult.

Work is fine as most of the time we communicate in English and I really appreciate the courtesy to switch from Norwegian to English when any non-Norwegian joins the conversation, I can&#8217;t say this is the norm in other countries.

Socializing has been hard because of different reasons:

  * Norwegians are shy by nature, with some exceptions of course but most of the time this is true
  * I am not very social by Mexican standards so that doesn&#8217;t help either
  * I don&#8217;t speak any Norwegian, courtesy in this case works against me because everyone prefers to switch to English rather than hearing us foreigners butcher the language
  * COVID-19 kind of limited my chances to go out and meet new people

But not everything is bad news, I&#8217;ve been able to cope with most things:

  * Weather -> Solved by learning how to dress properly, _ull untertøy_ (wool underwear) is one of the phrases I know very well by now. I also now own proper boots, a jacket and a raincoat
  * Work life -> It took me a while to get used to how things work over here, everyone is given a degree of freedom and a level of confidence I wasn&#8217;t used to, no micromanagement whatsoever. We define our set of tasks and make decisions consulting with our manager every once in a while, which I really like. During the course of the year one of my side projects became super relevant overnight, which is cool but things got hectic these last 2 months. No mayor complaints here
  * Socializing -> This one was the second hardest, problems aside, I was lucky to have colleagues from my Master&#8217;s program stay in Norway as well so we try to stay in touch and see each other regularly, I&#8217;ve been hanging out a lot with one of them (this is the guy I usually [go fishing](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/11/28/fishing-as-a-new-hobby/) with). Playing Dungeons and Dragons every Wednesday has been a good way to socialize with my co-workers outside work hours and one of the things I found out I enjoy a lot.
  * Language -> This one&#8217;s on me, I&#8217;ve missed the deadline to register for the beginner&#8217;s course and I only made an effort during the first months I was here. One of my goals for next year is to take a course and speak some Norwegian (Even if I sound like a caveman) because I want to talk to people outside work and maybe broaden my social circle
  * Food -> This one is the hardest, of course I suffered a bit being abroad for the past two years but I never imagined I&#8217;d be working abroad on a permanent basis. I&#8217;ve managed to find Jalapeño peppers and even white corn tortillas recently so that makes me happy

Skiing is something I&#8217;d really like to learn but haven&#8217;t been able to (I imagine resorts are closed), but I only got to [try for a day early in the year](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/03/13/skiing-and-covid-19/), got scared sh*tless and according to eye witnesses the falls were quite spectacular.

Let&#8217;s see how I do next year, for now I can say I&#8217;m pretty happy living here.
