## Humanetech Translation Project

Otherwise known as HTP (I personally prefer HTTP ðŸ˜› ), is a little project that started on the Humane Tech Community forum after my little comment about privacy related content available mostly in English, see this [entry](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/09/30/convenience-vs-privacy-round-2/) for context.

The project has officially started and is looking for translators, so if anyone is interested please head [here](https://community.humanetech.com/t/learn-how-you-can-participate-in-the-humanetech-translation-program/4994/2), apparently we&#8217;ve gathered quite a few translators already but it&#8217;s always nice to have more!

Some of the immediate goals have been already met: such as getting translators and setting up the translation environment.

## Privacy Label

I am also happy to share that I made a tiny contribution by translating Privacy Label to Spanish. The project aims to make it easy to convey how user data will be used.

Translation didn&#8217;t take a lot of time and I encourage anyone who can spare a few minutes to contribute to either [Privacy Label](https://www.privacylabel.org/learn/how-does-it-work) or ~~HTTP~~ HTP.
