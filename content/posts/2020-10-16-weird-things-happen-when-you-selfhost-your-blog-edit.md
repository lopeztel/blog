Interesting, I managed to screw up my blog. Logging in is impossible through a web browser, I get the message:

>502 Bad Gateway
>
> -- <cite>nginx</cite>

This happened after messing around with the WP Reset plugin, apparently I deleted some custom table I shouldn’t have… Funnily enough I am still able to use the android app to create posts so not all hope is gone.

Weird things happen&#8230;.

Edit: Turns out I couldn&#8217;t access the login screen for my site but could access the comments section (you know the one where you can approve new comments, then from there Dashboard was broken but I could access the menu Tools -> WP Reset). I had the foresight of creating a snapshot before messing around with the plugin, I just couldn&#8217;t find a way to restore it, the more you know
