I was just recently thinking given the recent COVID-19 situation, the world is not ready to prioritize what is really important.

It feels like no one really notices importance of services like running water, electricity and above all medical care. What I see on the news nowadays leads me to believe that no one really cares about anything as long as we&#8217;re not affected.

No one cared about COVID-19 until we couldn&#8217;t go out, until our Amazon or Aliexpress and overall cheap stuff from China couldn&#8217;t reach us in time.

Maybe COVID-19 is a slap on the face, interesting that something we can&#8217;t even see changes economy and everyday life so much.
