Let me start by saying that the purpose of this entry is not to say _&#8220;Look at how selfless I am for donating money to FOSS organizations or projects&#8221;_ so, with that in mind, I will not list any specific quantities because that is not the point I am trying to make. Having written the proper disclaimer, let&#8217;s get to it:

## My preferences

In the past month I have written about my projects and experiences with FOSS, self hosting and even digital art. Here&#8217;s the list of organizations/projects I support and why I chose them:

  * [Krita](https://krita.org/en/): I just loved how they&#8217;re working hard to include amazing brushes and textures by default. I didn&#8217;t try digital before because I&#8217;m used to traditional media (in particular watercolor).
  * [Yunohost](https://yunohost.org/#/whatsyunohost): Easy self-hosting solution, very nice people in the forums and even this blog runs on a Yunohost server!
  * <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-arm-20-08-released/1516" target="_blank">ManjaroARM</a>: I just love what they&#8217;re doing for the Pinebook, Pinephone and Raspberry Pi
  * [Fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/about/more): My mastodon instance and what started the whole &#8220;better/safer digital life&#8221; train I&#8217;m on
  * [Matrix.org](https://matrix.org/): I&#8217;m using my own <a href="https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Synapse</a> server for encrypted communication with my family, thanks to Yunohost.

(there are many more I&#8217;d like to support but, you know, adulting and paying the bills&#8230;)

## Why donate?

Aside from sharing my preferences I&#8217;d like to encourage you (my surely millions of readers that is ðŸ˜› ) to support any FOSS project you&#8217;ve found useful or interesting, either by donating a small amount of money or (even better) by contributing with time and coding expertise.
