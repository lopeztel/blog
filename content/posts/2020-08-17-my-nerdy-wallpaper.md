Just recently I found an interesting package in AUR, it&#8217;s called pacwall. Since I use Manjaro the installation quite simple through pacman or pamac.

The goal is simple, to have a visual representation of your installed packages and their dependencies. for more information and how to use it consult the [repo][1]

I just typed:

`pacwall -D -S 1920x1080` 

in my terminal to automatically set my desktop wall paper with the corresponding resolution and generate a corresponding .png file in my home directory

It is my understanding that it is possible to change the colors for every type of node and if you&#8217;re really into it, you can regenerate the wallpapaper every time a package is installed or removed.

Here&#8217;s mine:<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
