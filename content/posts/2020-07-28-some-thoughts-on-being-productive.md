This entry is going to be a bit more personal, I usually avoid all the touchy &#8211; feely subjects but there is something to be said about how we go about balancing our professional careers and private life.

Long story short, I think I work with brilliant people and lately I&#8217;ve been anxious about catching up and feeling a bit guilty whenever I catch myself at home being a couch potato.

After getting the impulse of devoting insane hours or even weekends on &#8220;getting up to speed&#8221;, a conclusion I came to was: _&#8220;That&#8217;s probably counterproductive&#8221;_

Given how the world works and we are constantly bombarded with the idea that we have to work hard and then harder I think it is OK to make peace with some facts (at least I&#8217;m trying to):

  * Not everyone is the same, therefore it is understandable to work at different speeds
  * Not every team member has the same tasks, therefore it is not possible to compare progress between them
  * Not everyone has the same background or experience so it is understandable to need others to make progress

After all these thoughts I haven&#8217;t stopped feeling anxious completely but at least it is a step in the right way

If you&#8217;re reading this and you&#8217;ve felt something similar I want to let you know that it is OK to step back, rest and take your time, after all we are only human and all we can do is our best
