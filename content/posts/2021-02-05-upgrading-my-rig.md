I finally got to make some upgrades to my desktop computer!

## Before {#before}

Just for context, my desktop computer was a hand-me-down that a friend just gave me because he had gotten a much better one. I took it and played around with it. After all these years this was the first time I owned a computer with a dedicated GPU (I know, sad but true)

These were the specs:<figure class="wp-block-table">

| Motherboard                                                                                                                                           | CPU                                                                                                                                                                                     | GPU                                                                                                                                                                               |

The computer could keep up with daily tasks quite well but I really wanted to game on it, it could only keep up with CS:GO and other light Steam games, I also started tweaking and doing minor upgrades with time&#8230;

Here&#8217;s a picture:

## Minor upgrades {#minor-upgrades}

My rental contract included &#8220;internet&#8221; in the amount I pay per month, what it didn&#8217;t specify was that my landlord would let me use a wifi repeater separated from his router by a **concrete wall**, so I needed a wireless network card&#8230; I got Asus [PCE-AC56](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/PCEAC56/) , which worked out of the box on Manjaro Linux

Another minor upgrade I made was buying a bluetooth adapter, the excuse was that now that I could game a bit I should use my cheapo Shanwan PS3 controller clone. So I got [Asus PCE-BT400](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/USBBT400/), again, worked out of the box no need to deal with drivers

In Arch based linux distros this section of the [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Gamepad#PlayStation_3.2F4_controller) explains that installing `bluez`, `bluez-plugins`, `bluez-utils` issuing the command `bluetoothctl` and pluging in the controller should register it as a paired device

## Now {#now}

Of course it was not enough and I decided to upgrade more, so I got an upgrade package from a local store since it was on sale:<figure class="wp-block-table">

| [Asus ROG Strix B450-F](https://rog.asus.com/us/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-b450-f-gaming-model/) | [AMD Ryzen 5 3600](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3600) | [XFX Radeon RX 580](https://www.xfxforce.com/gpus/amd-radeon-tm-rx-580-gts-xxx-edition-8gb-3) |</figure> 

Technically I bought the graphics card before the small upgrades I listed before, also I got what was available (Good luck trying to get either Nvidia or AMD higher end graphic cards as Linus would say) however I&#8217;m pretty sure the performance was choked by the old CPU, I&#8217;ll have to wait and see. I also bought a 1TB M.2 SATA SSD card and 2 8GB DDR4 2666MHz RAM sticks (same RAM as before, just double the speed)

Here are some pictures:

Please don&#8217;t judge my cable management. Can&#8217;t help but notice all I kept from the orginal gift was the case and the power supply ðŸ™‚
