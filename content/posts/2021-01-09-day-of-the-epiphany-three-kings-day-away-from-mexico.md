Following up on my series _&#8220;Celebrating holidays away from Mexico&#8221;_, after entries such as: a [rant about Mexican food on independence day](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/09/15/mexican-food/) and [day of the dead](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/11/02/day-of-the-dead-away-from-mexico/)

January 6th is **Día de Reyes**, the last date of what we Mexicans know as the [Guadalupe &#8211; Reyes marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe-Reyes_Marathon) (which is, in short, an extended holiday period for eating and drinking that starts on December 12th)

Being away from home and still a bit bitter about not being able to go back home for the holidays because of COVID-19, I contacted my baker friend and ordered **Rosca de Reyes** (roughly translates to King&#8217;s baguel I guess). My Rosca de Reyes is slightly different from the traditional one but it&#8217;s a passable representation:

Traditonal:

Since we Mexicans are all about eating, these big baguels usually have buried within a couple of plastic figurines of baby Jesus Christ (or others to collect and complete the Epiphany scene), the catch is that whoever gets those will have to pay for [tamales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamale) and [atole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atole) (corn dough with different fillings and basically liquid corn) on February 2nd ([**Día de la Candelaria**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_of_Jesus_at_the_Temple#Traditions_and_superstitions)). Needless to say, hilarity ensues when people try to cheat their way out of paying up, rules are pretty clear on this regard:

  * everyone cuts their own piece
  * if a kid gets baby Jesus, the parents pick up that tab for tamales
  * to ensure no cheating you must cut you piece in half horizontally as well and show that both halves of the bread are clean
  * you pick up the tab if baby Jesus is visible in one of the adjacent pieces after cutting your own

Everyone has fun stories about this date, for example:

  * Legend says my grandfather on my father&#8217;s side of the family was sneaky and once swallowed baby Jesus.
  * My great-grandfather on my mother&#8217;s side of the family was a prankster and a baker, so instead of the usual amount of plastic figurines, he&#8217;d make sure that every piece had at least a couple&#8230;

If memory serves right there are similar traditions in other [spanish speaking countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_cake#Spanish-speaking_countries), in Europe the Spanish call it _Roscón de Reyes_ and the French call it _Galette des Rois_.

I&#8217;d be interested to know about other countries traditions related to this date.
