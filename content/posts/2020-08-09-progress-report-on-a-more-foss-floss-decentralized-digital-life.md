For context, let me refer to my very first [entry][1], the idea was basically looking for alternatives, so here&#8217;s the long awaited progress report:

## Changes already in place

  1. Using [Mastodon][2] instead of Twitter
  2. Using [Pixelfed][3] instead of Instagram
  3. (On Android) Using [NewPipe][4] instead of YouTube, this one is quite cool, it has all the features you&#8217;d want: Download, Picture in Picture mode, Background Music reproduction…
  4. Using [Writefreely][5] and/or [WordPress][6] (Still haven&#8217;t decided) instead of other blogging platforms
  5. (On Android) Using [Signal][7] instead of WhatsApp, although that may change in the near future
  6. Using [Jitsi Meet][8] instead of Skype, Zoom, Google Hangouts
  7. Using [Protonmail][9] instead of Gmail (although not sure if FOSS/FLOSS, they maintain an [OpenPGP library][10])
  8. (On Android) Using [Simple Mobile Tools SMS Messenger][11] instead of Google Messages
  9. Using [Simple Mobile Tools Gallery][12] instead of Google Photos
 10. Using [Bitwarden][13] instead of LastPass
 11. (On Android) Using [andOTP][14] (at least for personal stuff)
 12. Using [F-Droid][15] instead of the Google Play Store whenever possible

## Changes in transition period

  1. Self-hosted [Nextcloud][16] instead of Dropbox, Google Drive, One Drive…
  2. Self-hosted [Gitea][17] instead of Github (currently only mirroring)
  3. Self-hosted [Piwigo][18] gallery instead of Google Photos (more info on my setup [here][19])
  4. Self-hosted email (problems with outgoing port 25)
  5. Self-hosted [Synapse][20] ([Matrix][21] server) in testing phase, could replace Signal by [Element][22] if tests show promising results
  6. Calendar synchronization using Nextcloud instead of Google Calendar (Android apps: [Simple Mobile Tools Calendar][23], [DAVX5][24] and [OpenTasks][25])
  7. (On Android) Trying to use [OsmAnd][26] instead of Google Maps **(This is by far the hardest change to be made)**

## Compromises

  1. Facebook is still the platform where everyone plans events so I need that just to follow-up on them (not actively in use)
  2. Whatsapp and Facebook messenger as backup messaging (Trying to move friends and family over to Signal or Element)
  3. Can&#8217;t seem to get away from Microsoft: Teams, Outlook and Microsoft Authenticator are used for work
