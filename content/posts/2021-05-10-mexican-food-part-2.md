This is a bit of a follow-up on my previous rant on Mexican food and its representation abroad, see the previous [entry][1], since last time I&#8217;ve tried to show &#8220;the way&#8221; to my Norwegian friends and I thought it would be nice to document the process.

I&#8217;ve also written about food during some holidays, see:

  * [Day of the Dead away from Mexico](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/11/02/day-of-the-dead-away-from-mexico/)
  * [Day of the Epiphany away from Mexico](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2021/01/09/day-of-the-epiphany-three-kings-day-away-from-mexico/)

The first time I cooked something remotely close to real Mexican food had to wait until I got a care package, after Christmas-New Year&#8217;s, it contained some traditional sweets (long gone by the time of writing of this entry), some [Mezcal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezcal) (I like to describe the flavor as &#8220;smoked&#8221; Tequila) and some flasks of [Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_sauce) and an assortment of dry peppers

The first time I shared some of my country&#8217;s food with some friends, we made [Enchiladas de Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_sauce#Preparation_and_consumption), deep fried white corn tortillas, stuffed with chicken, covered in mole, sour cream, cheese and onion

Just yesterday we made [Tacos dorados](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taquito), which is something you&#8217;d get from mom back home (huge shout out to my mom), we rolled some boiled potato or chicken with some diced onion and coriander into a white corn tortilla taco, then deep fried and covered in sour cream, lettuce, cheese and salsa:

Of course the salsa was quite important and had to be mom-approved. I used [Chile Guajillo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guajillo_chili), [Chile Pasilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasilla) and [Chile Ancho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poblano), some garlic, onions and tomatoes, basically threw everything on a pan for a while and then in the blender. I also made some [Guacamole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guacamole)

Food was very good, I&#8217;m planning on sharing more in the future
