Ever since I started looking into the Fediverse, FOSS/FLOSS, privacy and self-hosting I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging and helpful the community can be.

As an example: in [Fosstodon][1] all my interactions have been very nice, from sharing random unrelated stuff to asking for advice on more technical matters everyone has always been helpful and willing to give advice.

Another great experience I had recently was related with the [yunohost][2] project (long story short, my Open Media Vault setup went down in flames, tutorial coming shortly), being kind of a big project one would think that as an individual, communication would be slow or hard, kind of like with companies as a consumer.

Surprisingly, all it took was a toot and a post on their [forum][3] to get up and running.

My first interaction was related to the fact that the available Raspberry pi [image][4] was neither the latest version (4.0.3 at the time of writing) nor booting on my pi, so after reading that the pi 4 was not supported officially and tooting about it I was surprised to receive a response from [@yunohost][5] prompting me to install on top of [Raspberry Pi OS lite][6] (it&#8217;ll always be Raspbian for me) using a curl one [liner][7].

My second interaction, and after installing some [apps][8], I came across another issue, the [synapse][9] ([Matrix][10] server) app installation failed and I wrote this [post][11] on the forum. I was surprised again to receive an answer in less than 24 hours! This time I just installed from the testing branch on their repo.

I have nothing but good things to say so far, and I will donate to the project, it is only fair and they are doing a great job.
