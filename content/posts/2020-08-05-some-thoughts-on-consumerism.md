I like to keep up to date with the latest news on the consumer electronics market (newest phones, laptops and processors) and lately I&#8217;ve found myself thinking: _&#8220;That looks like a great phone/laptop, I should get it&#8221;_.

Then the thought that usually follows is _&#8220;Maybe I don&#8217;t really need it&#8221;_

That&#8217;s the thing, media constantly bombards us with ads to get new things/gadgets when we already own perfectly working devicesâ€¦

By the way, this blog entry was written from my still good Moto Z Play (2016), which still lasts for a whole working day with around 37% battery left.
