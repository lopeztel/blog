A brief summary: I&#8217;ve been looking into privacy friendly alternatives to software most of us use or used in our everyday lives. To be more precise, an alternative to [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) for communication within my family. Long story short: I lost this one&#8230;

A while back I switched from WhatsApp to [Signal](https://www.signal.org/#signal) and kind of forced my family to switch as well, however:

Signal requires a phone number and depends on centralized servers. I know there are ways to have your own server but as far as I know the process can be difficult, there is no one-to-one video calls on desktop (yet) and there is no support for federation out of the box (If you, the reader, have more info on this point I&#8217;d love to know since I have only researched on the surface of the topic)

My current solution is a [synapse](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/server/synapse) installation and [element](https://element.io/) client app on desktop, iOS and android device, which seems to meet all the requirements I had plus the installation process was fast and easy on my [raspberrypi yunohost server](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/08/08/my-raspberry-pi-server-with-yunohost/)

On the technical side of things everything is fine and works, we are able to communicate securely through a home server I own and manage but the thing is: My family only uses element to communicate with me and they keep relying on WhatsApp to communicate between them and others. It is a bit frustrating but at least our video calls are private so there is a silver lining here.

The arguments to use it have been many: &#8220;there are no customizable stickers&#8221;, &#8220;What do you have to hide? don&#8217;t be so paranoid&#8221;, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if I am spied on, I&#8217;m not that interesting&#8221;, &#8220;all my friends are on WhatsApp and I like to have a single app for all my conversations&#8221;

I have been trying to explain the risks of thinking like this and after being frustrated for a while I realized that most people concerned with privacy have an electronic or computer engineering (or similar) backgrounds, we sometimes are a bit big-headed (at least I have been at times) and forget how it is to have no understanding of how apps and communication work. 

I&#8217;d like to use this entry post to encourage people to be more understanding and patient while trying to explain privacy risks or persuading non-tech oriented people, after all, even when we&#8217;re right, no one likes an arrogant smart-ass and forcing everyone to be more privacy oriented is impossible.

Let&#8217;s keep it up, do and take what you can.
