As mentioned in a previous entry, I started a new job in Norway last year, here are my thoughts so far:

First of all, a couple of interviews related to my position took place 3 weeks before my Master&#8217;s thesis was due, all that can be said about that is: lots of excitement, I remember getting results and figures the weekend before the final interview took place.

After a well deserved month of relaxation back home (Mexico), my first day on my new job was a week before the company&#8217;s Christmas party and it wasn&#8217;t long after that everything was slowing down and everyone was away from the office so not much time to get used to a new country and _learn the ropes_ at the new workplace.

During January, February and the middle of March things slowly started to ramp up and I started to understand a bit more on how things worked around here, from using the printer (always a pain, don&#8217;t deny it) and meeting colleagues, to slightly more complicated tasks related to electronics and coding.

Then, in the middle of march disaster happened and COVID-19 started to spread, so I was left with doing a couple of tasks here and there (not complaining, still got paid and everything was more or less fine).

Ever since health regulations allowed for people to start going back to their offices with a few minor considerations, things have started to ramp up again but now I can&#8217;t help but feel like I haven&#8217;t been able to keep up and learn as fast as I should, blaming the pandemic is easy but still&#8230;

It is also important to note that my colleagues are really brilliant people and no one has mentioned anything about my performance, maybe anxiety got the best of me or I am just pushing myself too far&#8230; Or is it that people in Norway are just that chill and like to take their time? Only time will tell, in the meantime, gotta keep at it.
