For some time now, starting from spring last year, I&#8217;ve been going out to fish (from the fjord&#8217;s shore) with 2 of my friends here.

Let&#8217;s just say that we&#8217;re not very good at this, a lot of our lures/hooks have been lost to seaweed and even bad knots that came loose while throwing (that one was me by the way ðŸ˜› )

Only one I managed to catch something, gutting, bleeding and cutting the fish was an experience and it makes you appreciate the convenience of supermarkets. On the bright side this comes with a sense of satisfaction and maybe that is why I found the fish super tasty after I added salt, pepper, ground garlic and a lot of butter and threw it in the oven for like 20 mins.

![Notice my very crude cutting technique](https://lopeztel.noho.st/piwigo/_data/i/galleries/blog_media/IMG_20200810_165210893-1-768x1024-me.jpg#center)

# Why do it if you suck?

It&#8217;s quite simple, it provides the perfect excuse to go outdoors (a 15 minute drive will get you to some very nice places), hang out and enjoy the landscapes.

It provides a nice complement to my job and other hobbies (selfhosting, playing around with electronics and painting), for which I just sit in front of a computer all day. Although running and swimming are nice too, being outdoors just chilling (literally lately), maybe get to nice spots after a bit of a hike and occasionally fishing something are things I enjoy and provide some balance.
