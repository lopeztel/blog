I usually like to hate on Facebook but I&#8217;ve got to admit it is useful **if used responsibly**, this time thanks to it, I found out that a mexican baker had moved to town and I managed to get _&#8220;Pan de Muerto&#8221;_ (Dead bread?).

![Individually packed because of COVID-19 measures](https://lopeztel.noho.st/piwigo/galleries/blog_media/IMG_20201101_162223348-768x576.jpg#center)

I feel like I have to describe it for non-mexicans: for starters, it&#8217;s not made of dead people ðŸ˜›

It&#8217;s like a not so dense bun (with a twist of orange) and covered in sugar. The little blobs on top are supposed to be either:

  * A little corpse (I like to think that the big blob it&#8217;s the belly)
  * Devoted catholics argue that it is a cross
  * bones that represent the dead and a baked tear drop on the bread to represent goddess [Chimalma][1]&#8216;s tears for the living, according to [Wikipedia][2]

These are part of the offering table we set in our homes and graveyards for our loved ones that come back to visit on November 1st and 2nd.

I just had to take the chance, order a bunch and share a little bit of my country&#8217;s culture with my co-orkers. The purpose of this entry is to share further and how much it means to me with the rest of my millions of readers (yeah, right ðŸ˜€ )

Also, just for fun, I&#8217;d d like to point out that the movie _&#8220;Coco&#8221;_ is one of the best representations of Mexican day of the Dead out there, so big evil Disney gets a pass on this one.
