A bit of a followup on a previous [entry](https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2021/06/02/making-a-bluetooth-split-keyboard-part-1/), Iâ€™ve succeeded in turning a Chinese STM32F103 clone into a Black Magic Probe :

I found some instructions in [blackmagic-bluepill](https://github.com/koendv/blackmagic-bluepill) to follow

Iâ€™ll try to summarize:

  1. wiring is important!

  2. Since the whole point of making the BMP flasher/debugger was to flash the nRFmicro, I followed the instructions on the [nRFmicro repo](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/wiki/Bootloader#bluepill) got their supplied blackmagic binaries
  3. For some reason I had to fiddle around and hold the reset button before attaching a device (search STM32 bluepill connect under reset for more on this) , it was a hit and miss thing â€¦ (`arm-none-eabi-binutils`, `arm-none-eabi-gcc` and `arm-none-eabi-gdb` are installed at this point, this is the list of commands to follow:
  4. I couldnâ€™t load .bin files so I converted the downloaded binaries to .hex files

```bash
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -I binary -O ihex blackmagic_dfu.bin blackmagic_dfu.hex
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -I binary -O ihex blackmagic.bin blackmagic.hex

```

```bash
arm-none-eabi-gdb
target extended-remote /dev/ttyBmpGdb 
#/dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyACM1 if the device rules are not installed
monitor swdp_scan
#this should show the target board voltage and Something like
#No. Att Driver
#1      M4

#up until this point I was holding the target board's reset button
#I had to try multiple times to do the following step and releasing the reset
#button at the same time
attach 1
load ./blackmagic_dfu.hex 0x8000000
load ./blackmagic.hex 0x8002000
quit
```

Issuing `lsusb` yields:

So yes, I now have a fully operational **blackmagic-bluepill** ðŸ˜€
