My name is Luis David Lopez Tello Villafuerte (yes, my name was taken straight out of a telenovela and I was still writing my name when everyone else was answering exam question 2)

I am an Embedded Systems Engineer, born and raised in Mexico City but now living in Norway.

This blog is a weird mixture between random reflections and trying to document my journey into hobby electronics, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FOSS/FLOSS</a> and privacy friendly alternatives.

You can find me as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fosstodon.org/@lopeztel" target="_blank">@lopeztel</a> in Fosstodon and as <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lopeztel:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@lopeztel:matrix.org</a> in Matrix

## Quirks/Interests

In my free time I enjoy running (5-10K), swimming, painting with watercolors: both traditional media and digital (that was a recent effort, documented <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lopeztel.xyz/2020/06/25/linux-and-art-mix/" target="_blank">here</a>) and tinkering with electronics, with a recent interest in <a href="https://mqtt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MQTT</a>, WiFi and Bluetooth.
