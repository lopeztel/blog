So I ended up going to the beach with him and his fiancée. Yesterday, after an outdoors activity day sponsored by our company, one of my team mates said: “By the way, we’re flipping some burgers for dinner today, I live pretty close by, wanna come over to our place? Since we work together I figured we should get to know each other“. I ended up coming back home at 22:00. All these interactions have meant a lot because they were not initiated by me and gave me the feeling of starting to fit in here. Funnily enough that’s all it takes, nice gestures.\n",
