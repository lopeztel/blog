  <div class="post-content"><p>As the title suggests, it’s been a little over a year since I moved to Norway for work… It’s been a challenging year to say the least, and not only because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>For starters, it’s been hard to get used to this weird country’s ways (and I mean this in the most endearing way), from personal space, weather and language to food (I am Mexican and I cannot stress the importance of food enough, see my <a href="https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/09/15/mexican-food/">previous entry</a> for reference). Everything has been a bit difficult.</p>
<p>Work is fine as most of the time we communicate in English and I really appreciate the courtesy to switch from Norwegian to English when any non-Norwegian joins the conversation, I can’t say this is the norm in other countries.</p>
<p>Socializing has been hard because of different reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Norwegians are shy by nature, with some exceptions of course but most of the time this is true</li>
<li>I am not very social by Mexican standards so that doesn’t help either</li>
<li>I don’t speak any Norwegian, courtesy in this case works against me because everyone prefers to switch to English rather than hearing us foreigners butcher the language</li>
<li>COVID-19 kind of limited my chances to go out and meet new people</li>
</ul>
<p>But not everything is bad news, I’ve been able to cope with most things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather -&gt; Solved by learning how to dress properly, <em>ull untertøy</em> (wool underwear) is one of the phrases I know very well by now. I also now own proper boots, a jacket and a raincoat</li>
<li>Work life -&gt; It took me a while to get used to how things work over here, everyone is given a degree of freedom and a level of confidence I wasn’t used to, no micromanagement whatsoever. We define our set of tasks and make decisions consulting with our manager every once in a while, which I really like. During the course of the year one of my side projects became super relevant overnight, which is cool but things got hectic these last 2 months. No mayor complaints here</li>
<li>Socializing -&gt; This one was the second hardest, problems aside, I was lucky to have colleagues from my Master’s program stay in Norway as well so we try to stay in touch and see each other regularly, I’ve been hanging out a lot with one of them (this is the guy I usually <a href="https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/11/28/fishing-as-a-new-hobby/">go fishing</a> with). Playing Dungeons and Dragons every Wednesday has been a good way to socialize with my co-workers outside work hours and one of the things I found out I enjoy a lot.</li>
<li>Language -&gt; This one’s on me, I’ve missed the deadline to register for the beginner’s course and I only made an effort during the first months I was here. One of my goals for next year is to take a course and speak some Norwegian (Even if I sound like a caveman) because I want to talk to people outside work and maybe broaden my social circle</li>
<li>Food -&gt; This one is the hardest, of course I suffered a bit being abroad for the past two years but I never imagined I’d be working abroad on a permanent basis. I’ve managed to find Jalapeño peppers and even white corn tortillas recently so that makes me happy</li>
</ul>
<p>Skiing is something I’d really like to learn but haven’t been able to (I imagine resorts are closed), but I only got to <a href="https://lopeztel.xyz/blog/2020/03/13/skiing-and-covid-19/">try for a day early in the year</a>, got scared sh*tless and according to eye witnesses the falls were quite spectacular.</p>
<p>Let’s see how I do next year, for now I can say I’m pretty happy living here.</p>
