<p>My rental contract included ‚Äúinternet‚Äù in the amount I pay per month, what it didn‚Äôt specify was that my landlord would let me use a wifi repeater separated from his router by a <strong>concrete wall</strong>, so I needed a wireless network card‚Ä¶ I got Asus <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/PCEAC56/">PCE-AC56</a> , which worked out of the box on Manjaro Linux</p>
<p>Another minor upgrade I made was buying a bluetooth adapter, the excuse was that now that I could game a bit I should use my cheapo Shanwan PS3 controller clone.
