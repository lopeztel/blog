      <description>For context, let me refer to my very first entry, the idea was basically looking for alternatives, so hereâ€™s the long awaited progress report:
Changes already in place Using Mastodon instead of Twitter Using Pixelfed instead of Instagram (On Android) Using NewPipe instead of YouTube, this one is quite cool, it has all the features youâ€™d want: Download, Picture in Picture mode, Background Music reproductionâ€¦ Using Writefreely and/or WordPress (Still havenâ€™t decided) instead of other blogging platforms (On Android) Using Signal instead of WhatsApp, although that may change in the near future Using Jitsi Meet instead of Skype, Zoom, Google Hangouts Using Protonmail instead of Gmail (although not sure if FOSS/FLOSS, they maintain an OpenPGP library) (On Android) Using Simple Mobile Tools SMS Messenger instead of Google Messages Using Simple Mobile Tools Gallery instead of Google Photos Using Bitwarden instead of LastPass (On Android) Using andOTP (at least for personal stuff) Using F-Droid instead of the Google Play Store whenever possible Changes in transition period Self-hosted Nextcloud instead of Dropbox, Google Drive, One Driveâ€¦ Self-hosted Gitea instead of Github (currently only mirroring) Self-hosted Piwigo gallery instead of Google Photos (more info on my setup here) Self-hosted email (problems with outgoing port 25) Self-hosted Synapse (Matrix server) in testing phase, could replace Signal by Element if tests show promising results Calendar synchronization using Nextcloud instead of Google Calendar (Android apps: Simple Mobile Tools Calendar, DAVX5 and OpenTasks) (On Android) Trying to use OsmAnd instead of Google Maps (This is by far the hardest change to be made) Compromises Facebook is still the platform where everyone plans events so I need that just to follow-up on them (not actively in use) Whatsapp and Facebook messenger as backup messaging (Trying to move friends and family over to Signal or Element) Canâ€™t seem to get away from Microsoft: Teams, Outlook and Microsoft Authenticator are used for work Day 11 of #100DaysToOffload</description>

      <description>Ever since discovering the Fediverse and reading toots from awesome people in Fosstodon, a little idea started to take shape in my head: perhaps its not that hard to self host, there are tons of tutorials and resources out thereâ€¦And I need some alternative to google photos to share albums with my family back home
Hardware After some research and settled for a RaspberryPi server/NAS, now, the purists will say that it is not the ideal platform to host but I think it is perfect to get started and learn the basics or as a hobby, then you can move on to the big boy fancy server hardware.</description>

      <description>Privacy and social networks Welcome stranger, let me start by saying this blog is just meant to be a space to share my thoughts and because I find it therapeutic, donâ€™t expect the next best novel ðŸ™‚
Now, letâ€™s get right to it: I had always known that big tech companies such as Facebook or Google donâ€™t let you have free accounts out of the goodness of their CEOâ€™s hearts, I also knew that their revenue comes mostly from ads, targeted ads.</description>
