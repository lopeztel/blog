      <description>This is a bit of a follow-up on my previous rant on Mexican food and its representation abroad, see the previous entry, since last time I‚Äôve tried to show ‚Äúthe way‚Äù to my Norwegian friends and I thought it would be nice to document the process.
I‚Äôve also written about food during some holidays, see:
Day of the Dead away from Mexico Day of the Epiphany away from Mexico The first time I cooked something remotely close to real Mexican food had to wait until I got a care package, after Christmas-New Year‚Äôs, it contained some traditional sweets (long gone by the time of writing of this entry), some Mezcal (I like to describe the flavor as ‚Äúsmoked‚Äù Tequila) and some flasks of Mole and an assortment of dry peppers</description>

      <description>Following up on my series ‚ÄúCelebrating holidays away from Mexico‚Äù, after entries such as: a rant about Mexican food on independence day and day of the dead
January 6th is D√≠a de Reyes, the last date of what we Mexicans know as the Guadalupe ‚Äì Reyes marathon (which is, in short, an extended holiday period for eating and drinking that starts on December 12th)
Being away from home and still a bit bitter about not being able to go back home for the holidays because of COVID-19, I contacted my baker friend and ordered Rosca de Reyes (roughly translates to King‚Äôs baguel I guess).</description>

      <description>I usually like to hate on Facebook but I‚Äôve got to admit it is useful if used responsibly, this time thanks to it, I found out that a mexican baker had moved to town and I managed to get ‚ÄúPan de Muerto‚Äù (Dead bread?).
I feel like I have to describe it for non-mexicans: for starters, it‚Äôs not made of dead people üòõ
It‚Äôs like a not so dense bun (with a twist of orange) and covered in sugar.</description>
