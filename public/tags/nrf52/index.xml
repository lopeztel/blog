      <description>This is a followup on a previous entry
It has been a while since I last wrote about this but I’ve been busy:
Flashing the first nRFmicro The very fist attempt at flashing the bootloader to my nRFmicro board failed miserably because I botched some pins on the main module so I used this as an excuse and bought Pine64’s hammerhead kit to repair my soldering poor job, which seemed to work</description>

      <description>A bit of a followup on a previous entry, I’ve succeeded in turning a Chinese STM32F103 clone into a Black Magic Probe :
I found some instructions in blackmagic-bluepill to follow
I’ll try to summarize:
wiring is important! Since the whole point of making the BMP flasher/debugger was to flash the nRFmicro, I followed the instructions on the nRFmicro repo got their supplied blackmagic binaries For some reason I had to fiddle around and hold the reset button before attaching a device (search STM32 bluepill connect under reset for more on this) , it was a hit and miss thing … (arm-none-eabi-binutils, arm-none-eabi-gcc and arm-none-eabi-gdb are installed at this point, this is the list of commands to follow: I couldn’t load .</description>

      <description>It seems that it is normal for me to buy stuff/parts/devkits and let them accumulate some dust before getting back to the project pile …
Just recently I read on the Pine64 Blog June update that Infinitime 1.2 was coming soon… Then I remembered I had ordered a PineTime devkit (part of the first batch ever actually) so I decided to find it and flash working firmware on it…
I attempted to flash it with a STM bluepill Black Magic Probe first:</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since I last posted something remotely technical so I thought this would do this entry
All the work is based on the Lily58 split keyboard, we will be using the nRFmicro board, which in turn will be the brain of each keyboard half
The first step was to make the nRFmicro board using the soldering guide in the repo, needless to say the process was complicated but a very good excuse to use my new Pinecil</description>
